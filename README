FB-Research is a tool to do research on social connections on facebook.

It helps to automatically query posts, comments and likes and provides
structures to save friendship-connections and invitations to events.

Using a casperjs-script it also allows you to make screenshots of posts and
associated comments and likes.

However you need to set the following environment variables:

* OAUTH_TOKEN -> include a valid oauth token for use with facebook
* FB_EMAIL -> Facebook login (email) for screenshot creation
* FB_PASSWORD -> Facebook login (password) for screenshot creation
