FB-Research is a tool to do research on social connections on facebook.

It helps to automatically query posts, comments and likes and provides
structures to save friendship-connections and invitations to events.

Using a casperjs-script it also allows you to make screenshots of posts and
associated comments and likes.

However you need to set the following environment variables:

* OAUTH_TOKEN -> include a valid oauth token for use with facebook - read [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12168452/long-lasting-fb-access-token-for-server-to-pull-fb-page-info/21927690#21927690)
* FB_EMAIL -> Facebook login (email) for screenshot creation
* FB_PASSWORD -> Facebook login (password) for screenshot creation

You can run the shell like so:

`ruby fb_research.rb`


or run a script within the shell like so:

`ruby fb_research.rb scripts/my_script.rb`
